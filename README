About the dataset: 
he data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it,
indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The label column tells the value of the digit drawn in the image.

I have used the Decision tree classifier and the SVM classifier for finding the digit represented by the image and calculated the accuracy scores respectively.
For this project, the accuracy scores are 85.5% and 97.6% respectively for the Decision tree classifier and the SVM classifier.
